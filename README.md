### Who Am I?
Currently I'm a self-taught developer student. I'm focusing towards front end development. HTML, CSS, SASS and Javascript is my thing, as well as frameworks like Angular and React (mainly on React right now!).
Looking forward to learn React Native, MERN stack and whatever interests me!
